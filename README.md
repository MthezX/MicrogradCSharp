[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MthezX/MicrogradCSharp)](https://github.com/MthezX/MicrogradCSharp/releases)

MicrogradCSharp is an open-source AI project that implements a tiny scalar-valued automatic differentiation (autograd) engine and a Neural Network library for C# within the Unity game engine. This project is inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd, and it aims to provide developers with the tools to build and train neural networks easily.

## Features

- **Automatic Differentiation**: MicrogradCSharp includes a simple and efficient autograd engine that allows for easy computation of gradients.
- **Neural Network Library**: Build, train, and evaluate neural networks with minimal setup.
- **Unity Integration**: Designed specifically for use within the Unity game engine, making it easy to incorporate AI into your games.
- **Open Source**: This project is open for contributions, allowing developers to enhance its capabilities.

## Installation

To get started with MicrogradCSharp, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MthezX/MicrogradCSharp/releases). Download the package, extract it, and follow the instructions to integrate it into your Unity project.

## Usage

Once you have installed MicrogradCSharp, you can start using the autograd engine and neural network library in your Unity scripts. Below is a simple example to demonstrate how to create a neural network and perform training.

### Example: Simple Neural Network

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Micrograd;

public class SimpleNN : MonoBehaviour
{
    private NeuralNetwork nn;

    void Start()
    {
        nn = new NeuralNetwork(new int[] { 2, 3, 1 });
        Train();
    }

    private void Train()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        {
            var input = new double[] { Random.value, Random.value };
            var target = new double[] { input[0] + input[1] }; // Simple addition target

            nn.Train(input, target);
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Components

- **NeuralNetwork Class**: This class manages the layers and weights of your network.
- **Train Method**: Use this method to feed data into the network and adjust weights accordingly.
- **Activation Functions**: Choose from various activation functions provided in the library.
